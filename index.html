    <h2>About:</h2>
    <p class="description">
        This is a table of behaviors observed in various Android devices' GPUs while running <a href="https://github.com/MangoShip/LitmusTestAndroid">LitmusTestAndroid</a>.
        The test was performed for over 150 configurations of randomly generated parameters with 100 test iterations.
        Each device was tested with a different range of numbers and sizes of workgroups. This range was determined based on the number and size of workgroups
        that produced the most interleaved behaviors under a stressed testing environment. This was to increase the chance of seeing weak behaviors. 
    </p>
    <h2>About the table:</h2>
    <p class="description">
        The numbers in the green cell represent sequential behaviors, the numbers in the blue cell represent interleaved behaviors, 
        and the numbers in the red cell represent weak behaviors. The numbers in the first row represent the total number of behaviors 
        observed in 150 configurations, and the numbers in the second row represent the percentage out of all the behaviors in that test. 
        Clicking on each device's name will let you download a json file that contains the test results and parameters of all 150 configurations
        tested with that device. Clicking on a test name (e.g. Message Passing) will direct you to GPUHarbor's WebGPU Memory Model Testing 
        website where you can receive more information about that litmus test.
