    <p class="description" style="background-color: #FFCCCC;">
        Note: Currently, the conformance testing is under construction, meaning a failed test result doesn't necessarily mean an
        implementation bug. Thank you for patience while we develop this tool.

        The <a href="https://gpuharbor.ucsc.edu/webgpu-mem-testing/conformance/">Conformance Test</a> evaluates the performance 
        of a set of tuned parameters on uncovering potential violations of Vulkan memory consistency model. There will be two methods 
        of running weak memory tests: running with single memory location and running with barriers between instructions. 
        There will also be two methods of running coherence tests: running with single memory location and running with RMW instruction. 
        A weak behavior on any test represents a violation of Vulkan memory consistency model. The test was performed for over 50 
        configurations of randomly generated parameters with 100 test iterations. The list of test names in the green cell represent 
        the tests that were passed, and the list of test names in the red cell represent the tests that were not passed.
